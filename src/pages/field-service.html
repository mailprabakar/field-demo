                It is at the core of every utility provider to fulfill and
                exceed customer expectations in Field Services Management.
                However, the traditional system of Field service management
                fails to meet up with these expectations. This is largely due to
                its inefficiencies in processes and operations.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this system, operations such as logging, monitoring, and
                control of numerous variables are performed by human labor and
                prone to much error. Also, tracking all unprecedented changes
                on-site demands a significant amount of time and precision.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among other things, delays, miscommunications, incorrect and
                incomplete information are common drawbacks of the system.
                Notable changes began to occur in the wake of the increased
                adoption of mobile devices and connected systems. Many Field
                Service Management companies adopted mobile apps and similar FSM
                technologies or software that assisted them in providing better
                services to customers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, a novel set of challenges arose with the global
                COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, FSM contractors are saddled with
                keeping technicians and customers safe as well as providing
                essential field services.
              </p>
              <p>
                To combat these challenges, experts have suggested using certain
                guidelines, including efficient Field Service Management
                software, to reduce visits to the field.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a poll conducted by TSIA on their State of Field Services
                webinar, 88% of the attendees admitted that Field Services
                Engineer deployments had been impacted

          <p>
            Some of the challenges of the Field Services Management industry
            amid the COVID-19 pandemic are as belows
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Limited On-site service delivery:</strong> Before the
              outbreak of the pandemic, field technicians worked with a schedule
              and were assigned to specific on-site jobs. They were also
              expected to maintain assignments to meet customersâ€™ expectations.
              However, with the imposition of the work from home mandates,
              travel bans, closure of offices, and other restrictions due to the
              pandemic, field engagements have drastically reduced. Contractors
              are concerned about the safety and health of employees and
              customers. As a result, on-site jobs of technicians are limited to
              critical cases only.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Emerging Technology:</strong> Utility providers who are
              reluctant to embrace new and emerging technology face several
              challenges, especially in this time of crisis. The world is
              evolving, and field service management services have to evolve to
              remain relevant and provide effective services to customers.
              Sadly, many utility providers find it hard to abandon antiqued
              software, materials, specifications, and procedures because of the
              time and money they invested. A typical example is the use of
              papers to log and document field information instead of easy to
              use, time-saving digital devices that will prevent loss of vital
              information, and properly organize workflow.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Safety and Liability:</strong> The safety of field workers
              is one of the most pressing concerns of field managers,
              particularly in this pandemic. This is because there are serious
              cases where dispatching technicians to the field is inevitable. In
              such situations, the health of these employees might be
              jeopardized. Also, employees are likely to quit their jobs if they
              feel their safety is not prioritized. Therefore, it has become
              important for FSx companies to invest in safety tools and
              techniques to protect employees.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Lack of communication with Field Technicians:</strong> It
              is imperative for supervisors to constantly track technicians
              while on the field to enable information flow. Among other things,
              communication between field workers and back-office is important
              for implementing necessary changes during operations. However,
              real-time communication is often hindered by several factors,
              including weak network signals, a prominent feature of remote
              areas.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Fielda is a mobile Field Services Management Platform specifically
            designed to enhance and accelerate field service processes
            (inspection, work, and service orders) by eliminating manual tools
            (paper and pen, forms, or human memory) to track and complete field
            works.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fielda mobile app is simple and easy to use and install on any IOS
            device (iPhones and iPads).
          </p>
          <p>
            As a digital solution platform, Fielda caters to the needs of small,
            medium, and large companies or workforces in various sectors and
            industries, not exempting telecom, oil and gas, electric companies,
            utility workers, local governments, and much more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fielda can also help to connect the assets of the Utility providers
            so that tickets are automatically logged by the asset, and proactive
            technician dispatches for these services can happen even without a
            scheduled field inspection To successfully survive these tough
            times, field service organizations must adopt new strategies and
            technologies at every level of operation, to optimize its services
            and retain clients. All necessary safety measures must also be put
            in place to protect employees and customers from the dangers of the
            virus. Fielda software offers solutions to these new problems and
            eliminates the inefficiencies inherent in the traditional systems.
